    <p>Hello, I’m Lacey. I’m a Seattle-based web designer & developer who spends her days (and often nights) creating, coding, researching and problem-solving. I’ve been working on websites for several years as a web administrator, e-commerce
      specialist, business owner and hobbyist. When I’m not creating through code, I’m taking pictures, loving my dog and traveling the world with my hubby.</p>
